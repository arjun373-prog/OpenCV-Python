-> Digital images are typically stored in a matrix
There are two types of digital images 
1. Grey scale images [ Each pixel represents intensity of only one shade i.e, how bright or dark the pixel is( means it has only one channel) ]
2. Colored images[ In colored images we have three channels(Red Green Blue)]

-->Numpy
Numpy is a highly optimized library for numerical operations
Array struture is important because digital images are 2D arrays of PIXELS.
